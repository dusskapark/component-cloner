### Extra
I made this plugin since I thought it would be useful for myself and others. However I actually haven't been using Figma much recently, 
so I haven't been working on this as much. I will try to periodically check on this repository and merge in any changes. 

I've gotten several emails suggesting improvements and bug fixes so I want to make this public.

If people would like to help make this plugin even more useful, I would really appreciate it. Thanks!
